# Assignment 1

1.  Consider the Pareto distribution shown below.

$$
f(x;\beta) = \frac{\beta}{x^{\beta+ 1}}, x > 1
$$

a.  Find marginpar{(2)} the mean of the distribution. Suppose $\beta > 1$
b.  Find \marginpar{(2)} the method of moments estimator.
c.  Find \marginpar{(3)} the maximum likelihood estimator.
d.  Find \marginpar{(5)} the asymptotic distribution of the mle.

2.  Consider the uniform distribution on the interval (0,$\theta$). Consider the estimator $\hat{\theta} = 2\bar{X}$.

a.  Is \marginpar{(2)} the estimator unbiased? Prove. If not, what is the bias?
b.  What \marginpar{(2)} is the mean squared error of the estimator?
c.  Is \marginpar{(2)} this estimator sufficient? Prove.
